# Restaurant Menu

One of the dangers of typing the menu information directly into the website is that mistakes may be more likely to be made and information may become forgotten and out-of-date, especially if the information is listed in more than one place

My recommendation to the client: 
* Provide a link to an up-to-date PDF of the scanned physical menu that users can look at and download
* Highlight signature dishes in a Specialties detail page
* Perhaps, upload a PDF weekly of the specials document posted on the restaurant doors
* PDFs could be hosted through Google Docs with the shared link as a WordPress menu custom link
