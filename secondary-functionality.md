# Secondary Functionality

The client was advised of additional functionality, some of which was deemed to be unnecessary, at least for now.

## Deemed Unnecessary

* Google map- client felt people would be more likely to directly Google the restaurant or use GPS
* Contact form- client felt patrons would be more likely to call/email and restaurant laptop is not in use all of the time
* Reservations- client felt patrons would be more likely to call/email and restaurant laptop is not in use all of the time
