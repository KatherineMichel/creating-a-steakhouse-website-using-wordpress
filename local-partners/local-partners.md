# Local Partners

One goal of the website is to highlight area talent, events, and attractions. Currently, the list is limited to groups that have provided a service to Pretty Prairie Steakhouse, been sponsored by Pretty Prairie Steakhouse, or held an event or performance there. The list may be expanded in the future to include others.
