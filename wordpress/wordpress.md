# WordPress

I chose the WordPress web framework for this project. 

## Why WordPress?

There are three primary reasons why I chose WordPress:
* The client asked for this project to be completed very quickly and there are thousands of ready made WordPress themes that can be customized via dashboard and code to suit the project
* The website would need to be maintained in part by non-techies and this could be done through the famous WordPress admin dashboard
* Digital Ocean's One-Click WordPress installation would make deployment mostly painless

## What is WordPress?

[WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress) is an open-source content management system made up of code written in the language [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP). WordPress users can log into a dashboard and install any one of thousands of website themes and plugins created by a large, global community of WordPress developers. These themes and plugins are made available through https://wordpress.org/themes and online marketplaces. Due in part to the famous WordPress dashboard and ease of use, WordPress powers approximately [25% of all websites](https://ma.tt/2015/11/seventy-five-to-go) in the world, including many [powerful brands](https://vip.wordpress.com/clients). Like other web development frameworks, WordPress has its pros and cons. However, in certain situations, WordPress can be the perfect solution. 

## WordPress Use Cases

WordPress can be used in a variety of different ways. Here are some example use cases from easiest to more difficult: 

* WordPress user creates an account at https://wordpress.com, chooses a template, perhaps pays for some custom features, but is constrained to the functionality provided (the price to be paid for extreme ease of use)
* WordPress user creates an account with a web host, installs WordPress, obtains and installs a theme/plugins solely through the WordPress dashboard, without altering the code, but with greater freedom than if using https://wordpress.com
* WordPress user installs WordPress on personal computer, obtains a theme, and customizes the code directly via files on computer or through the WordPress dashboard, perhaps later deploying the result through a web host
* WordPress user creates a theme froms scratch, perhaps sells the theme to others to use, perhaps deploys theme through a web host for own personal or business website
