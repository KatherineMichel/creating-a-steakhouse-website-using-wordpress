# Secondary Functionality

The client was advised of a additional functionality, some of which was deemed to be unnecessary, at least for now.

## Deemed Unnecessary

* Google map- client felt people would be more likely to directly Google the restaurant or use GPS
* Contact form- client felt patrons would be more likely to call/email and restaurant laptop is not in use all of the time
* Reservations- client felt patrons would be more likely to call/email and restaurant laptop is not in use all of the time

## Deemed Possible

* Social media sharing/liking

Promotion: one or all of these may be used for promotion
* Info bar (theme plugin is not working; can use external plugin)
* Slide in Panel
* Popup 

Shop
* WooCommerce, Quick Cart View (shop integration, in person/by mail, SSL certificate possibly needed)
