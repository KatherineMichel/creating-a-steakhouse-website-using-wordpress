# Secondary Functionality

## Social Media

* Sharing/liking
* Google map- client felt unnecessary, thinks people are probably more likely to directly Google the restaurant or use GPS

## Communication

Both of these were deemed unnecessary at this time; patrons are more likely to call and restaurant laptop is not in use all the time
* Contact form
* Reservations

## Promotion

One or all of these may be used for promotion
* Info bar
* Slide in Panel
* Popup 

## Plugins

* Info bar plugin (theme plugin is not working; am using external plugin)
* WooCommerce, Quick Cart View (shop integration, in person/by mail, SSL certificate possibly needed)
* SEO (Yoast perhaps)
