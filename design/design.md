# Design

## Website design goals

* Create a design that is both rustic and elegant, and aesthetically pleasing
* The design should reflect the subject matter without being a caricature or overdone
* Anytime feasible, real photos should be used instead of stock photos
* The photos and content should give a well-balanced insight into the steakhouse, associated ventures, and community

## Usability goals

* Website maintenance will be as painless as possible in order to keep non-evergreen content up-to-date
* Users should have easy access to the information that is most important to them
* The website will be responsive (layout adapts to browser size)
* The website layout will have a logical flow
* Accessibility standards will be met

## Specific layout and functionality choices

* The site will be a multi-page site rather than a one page site. Links on the navbar may link to sections of the homepage, other pages, or external websites/documents
* Preferably, external links should open in a new window
* The navbar will be fixed (attached to the top and visible during scrolling), with no logo (or a placeholder that is the same color as the navbar, because back-to-top button will not appear without a logo in place)

## Example homepage layout

* Overall background: wood panelling
* Navbar: black or white, inverse color text, with brown or black while hovering
* Header: white text and separator on quintessential steak dinner photo with photo shopped contrast
* About us teaser: text and photo grid on slate background
* Signature dishes section: white background
* Slate footer

## Priority Info

* Contact and location info: hours, telephone number, email address, physical address
* Weekly specials
* Menu

## DRY

As often as possible, the website will adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Info and elements such as buttons will be repeated the fewest times possible in order to minimize updates. Attractice evergreen content will be used, with updates limited to specific areas of the website.
