# Professional Photos

One way to give a website a higher quality aesthetic is by using professional quality photos. There is a common perception that a photo can just be taken with a phone and will look great. However, photos that are not taken professionally may not look as good for various reasons (bad composition, bad lighting, no filters used, low quality resolution).
