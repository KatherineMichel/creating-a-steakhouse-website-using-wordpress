# Promotion Gap Analysis

Fleming's is a steakhouse chain with locations around the United States. My client asked me to do an analysis of the [Fleming's Steakhouse website](https://www.flemingssteakhouse.com) and [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/flemings), because the client is a customer of Fleming's Steakhouse and feels their website promotes their products and services well. See the [Fleming's Promotion Lightning Demo](flemings-promotion-lightning-demo.md) section for screenshots and comments. 

## Professional Photos

One way to give a website a higher quality aesthetic is by using professional quality photos. There is a common perception that a photo can just be taken with a phone and will look great. However, photos that are not taken professionally may not look as good for various reasons (bad composition, bad lighting, no filters used, low quality resolution). A professional quality photo was used above-the-fold on the homepage of the Pretty Prairie Steakhouse website and non-professional quality photos on the other pages, which is believed to suffice at this time. However, one way to sharpen up the look would be to commission a photographer to take staged photos to be used through the website, just as Fleming's has done with their website and Facebook page.

# Secondary Functionality

The client was advised of additional functionality, some of which was deemed to be unnecessary, at least for now.

## Deemed Unnecessary

* Google map- client felt people would be more likely to directly Google the restaurant or use GPS
* Contact form- client felt patrons would be more likely to call/email and restaurant laptop is not in use all of the time
* Reservations- client felt patrons would be more likely to call/email and restaurant laptop is not in use all of the time
