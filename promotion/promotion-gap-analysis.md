## Professional Photos

One way to give a website a higher quality aesthetic is by using professional quality photos. There is a common perception that a photo can just be taken with a phone and will look great. However, photos that are not taken professionally may not look as good for various reasons (bad composition, bad lighting, no filters used, low quality resolution). A professional quality photo was used above-the-fold on the homepage of the Pretty Prairie Steakhouse website and non-professional quality photos on the other pages, which is believed to suffice. However, one way to sharpen up the look would be to commission a photographer to take staged photos to be used through the website. An example of this is the [Fleming's Steakhouse website](https://www.flemingssteakhouse.com), which I've analyzed in another section of this GitBook.
