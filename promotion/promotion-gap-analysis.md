# Promotion Gap Analysis

Fleming's is a steakhouse chain with locations around the United States. My client asked me to do an analysis of the [Fleming's Steakhouse website](https://www.flemingssteakhouse.com) and [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/flemings), because the client is a customer of Fleming's Steakhouse and feels their website promotes their products and services well. See the [Fleming's Promotion Lightning Demo](flemings-promotion-lightning-demo.md) section for screenshots and comments. 

## Info Bars, Slide-In Panels, Popups

The Fleming's Steakhouse website homepage makes use of an info bar at the top of the screen (info about a special deal, with a link to more info), and slide-in panel at the right for making reservations. The info bar could also be at the bottom of the screen. The slide-in panel is open when the page renders and can be clicked closed, or closes as the user scrolls downward. Another option that the Fleming's Steakhouse does not use is a popup (a message or ad that covers the screen until the user clicks "x" to close). The Pretty Prairie Steakhouse website does not make use of any of these options at this time, but all are a possibility. 

## Professional Photos

One way to give a website a higher quality aesthetic is by using professional quality photos. There is a common perception that a photo can just be taken with a phone and will look great. However, photos that are not taken professionally may not look as good for various reasons (bad composition, bad lighting, no filters used, low quality resolution). A professional quality photo was used above-the-fold on the homepage of the Pretty Prairie Steakhouse website and non-professional quality photos on the other pages, which is believed to suffice at this time. However, one way to sharpen up the look would be to commission a photographer to take staged photos to be used through the website, just as Fleming's has done with their website and Facebook page.

## Special Deals

## Email Updates

Fleming's Steakhouse offers a service called Friend of Fleming's. Customers can submit their contact info including email, and birthday info. They will receive exclusive offers, email updates and a birthday gift. 

## Location Services

Fleming's Steakhouse is a chain that has locations across the U.S. Fleming's Steakhouse website requests to identify the user's location in order to provide location-specific information. Fleming's Steakhouse website also provides a "Locations" page with a drop down box for selecting location, and a page for each location with its unique details, including a link to a Google map. Pretty Prairie Steakhouse is one location at this time, and therefore most of this functionality is not applicable. The client was given the option of including a Google map on the site and felt it was unnecessary, believing that customers who do not already know where it is would be more likely to directly Google the restaurant or use GPS to find it. 


# Secondary Functionality

Deemed to be unnecessary, at least for now.

* Contact form- client felt patrons would be more likely to call/email and restaurant laptop is not in use all of the time
* Reservations- client felt patrons would be more likely to call/email and restaurant laptop is not in use all of the time
