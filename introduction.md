# Introduction

A client asked me to design and set up a professional-looking restaurant website in a very short amount of time, including a dashboard that non-techies could use. As part of this project, I would provide client consultation, strategic recommendations, requirements capture, wireframe and mockup creation, website design and deployment (hardware and software), admin training, and user feedback collection.
