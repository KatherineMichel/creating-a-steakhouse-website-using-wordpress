# Lessons Learned

* The theme was larger than I realized and after an ambiguous error, I altered the Apache server settings in order to upload the theme without incident
* The box part of the boxed version was larger than I realized on an larger desktop and whether or not to use this version would involve a tradeoff
* The header became ambiguously small on mobile, a tradeoff
* I decided to keep pages (including the homepage) short to minimize loading times and time spent scrolling on mobile
* The info bar part of the theme would not work and was not working in the demo showcasing it, so I found a free plugin that offered similar functionality and would talk to the client about possibly purchasing a more fully featured notification bar plugin. 
* Where reasonable, replaced pngs with jpgs for optimal loading, and used smart compression on jpgs
