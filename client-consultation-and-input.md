# Client Consultation and Input

## Client Consultation

Primary services rendered:
* Consultations with the client to explain options, educate, and give hardware, software, and strategy recommendations in association with Pretty Prairie Steakhouse, including reference to sister property Potter Creek Outfitters
* On premise assistance with account setup, software purchase, configuration, deployment
* Requirements capture
* Web design (wireframes, mockups)
* Admin training
* User feedback collection
* Ad hoc consultations and progress reports as needed

## Cliient Feedback

* After the theme choice was narrowed down to one, the client requested that several variations of the intended design be made to choose from
* Client said that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" and suggested that user research be conducted, such as talking to restaurant patrons in order to gather feedback
* Client expressed interest in promotions and suggested to take a look at the [Flemings Steakhouse](https://www.flemingssteakhouse.com) website which has "done a good job" of that; client also noted Flemings Steakhouse use of reservations, but said that is probably unnecessary for Pretty Prairie Steakhouse at this time
* Client said would prefer that homepage photo have baked potato instead of mashed potatoes; I explained to client that photo is a professional quality photo of a real Pretty Prairie Steakhouse dinner, using another photo may involve a tradeoff (if use stock photo, may be inauthentic, if use regular photo, will probably be lower quality, if want to have another professional quality photo, need to find someone with equipment and skills and will possibly need to pay). Along with client, decided to leave photo as is and may ask Hutchinson News if would do another news story due to change in ownership and take another similar photo with baked potato. Communicated to client that it would be okay to use another photo, but this one is very high quality and I would prefer to not compromise on quality for above-the-fold homepage. Client talked again about leveraging channels for promotion. 
* I offered a variety of options to the client, such as replacing a social media link in the footer with a Google map, or offering the steakhouse menu as a PDF rather than website text. Client did not have an opinion about these details. The website will be a work in progress, with updates made based on best practice and user feedback.
